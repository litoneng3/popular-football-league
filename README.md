# Creating my react router website named Popular football Leagues in the World.

For creating my react router website i used the command:
 # npx create-react-app popular-football-league
 After creating this , i went to project directory by using 
 # cd popular-football-league
 Then i used
 # npm start

 I changed the website title as Popular Football League and changed the favicon. 

 # Objective of this Website
 There are various features in this website. In the Leagues Page, you can see 20 popular football leagues' name, type in every card and every card has a show detail button. 
 When you click on the show detail button, it will take you in the new page named LeagueDetail and there are various information of the corresponding league such as the Banned, Badge, Logo, the year founded the club, country, gender, type of the games etc. There you can see a photo (if the league is for male there will be a male Team photo otherwise female Team photo). 
 After this you can see League details as paragraph. 
 At the footer section you can see three social icons facebook, twitter, youtube. By clicking these social icons anyone can go to the corresponding social media. 

 # Required libraries and software
 I used the react router in my website. 
 I also used react bootstrap, font awesome. I used conditional rendering, object destructuring properly. 

 # Assignment Requirements: 
 I used thesportsdb api for this website, by clicking in the card it will take in the router and i used the react router paramaters dynamically. From the router paramater i access the data and create a dynamic url and load data by using useEffect, useStates, useParams hooks. 
 I used the meaningful className, variables, function Name etc.
 After that i pushed the code in github and hosted my website in netlify. 
 For making responsive i used plain bootstrap.
